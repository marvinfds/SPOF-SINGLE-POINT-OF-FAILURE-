# SPOF-SINGLE-POINT-OF-FAILURE-
An arduino project to demonstrate how SPOF system can be handled
A SPOF is a part of the system that if fails will cause the whole system to stop working.one way to get over this and creating a robust
system is by adding redundancy in any potential point where there are high chances of failure.
To assess the potential SPOF in a system is to identify the critical equipment’s of a complex system that would cause a complete system
failure in case of a malfunction. It is advised that highly reliable system should not rely on such components’
